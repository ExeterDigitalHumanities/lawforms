Welcome to Lawforms, a project focusing on the study of legal documents in Persian and other languages associated with early modern South Asia. Such documents take a variety of forms, from royal grants to interpersonal contracts of sale and pawn, to more peripheral materials such as tax account books and private letters. They give us access into the lives of people who encountered such documents and offer windows into a lost world. Lawforms is funded by the European Research Council and led by the University of Exeter.

This repository presents these texts as TEI/XML documents, which can be reused and analysed according to a CC-BY license. You will also find encoding guidelines describing how the texts were transcribed, and metadata describing the people and places referenced by the documents.
